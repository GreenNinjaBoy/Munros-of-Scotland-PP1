# Munro Baggers

This website was developed for individuals who are interested in joining a walking club to explore some of the Scottish mountains called "Munros". Users of the sight can find a brief history of these Mountains, the benefits to walking regularly and also a motivational video within the homepage of the website. The Gallery page consists of various images of the Scottish countryside where some of the mountains are located. The website also features an equipment page that gives information on the equipment and preparation required before attempting a walk on one of these mountains and users may opt-in to the sign-up page which will deliver a newsletter on events on a monthly basis. This website was designed to be a starting point to create a community of new and existing hillwalkers interested in walking the Munros of Scotland.

A live version of the website can be accessed [here.](https://greenninjaboy.github.io/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1)
