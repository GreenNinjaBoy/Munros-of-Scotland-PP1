# Munro Baggers

This website was developed for individuals who are interested in joining a walking club to explore some of the Scottish mountains called "Munros". Users of the sight can find a brief history of these Mountains, the benefits to walking regularly and also a motivational video within the homepage of the website. The Gallery page consists of various images of the Scottish countryside where some of the mountains are located. The website also features an equipment page that gives information on the equipment and preparation required before attempting a walk on one of these mountains and users may opt-in to the sign-up page which will deliver a newsletter on events on a monthly basis. This website was designed to be a starting point to create a community of new and existing hillwalkers interested in walking the Munros of Scotland.

A live version of the website can be accessed [here.](https://greenninjaboy.github.io/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1)

# User Experience

## User Demographic
This Website was intended for:

 - Users who are interested in the Munros of Scotland.
 - Users who would like to know more about being prepared.
 - Users who would like to join a community eager climb the Munros of Scotland.

## User Stories
As a user of this website:

 - I would like to find out a bit information about the Munros.
 - I want to know what equipment I would need before attempting my walk.
 - I want to sign up to a newsletter informing me of any planned walks the club has.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were produced for the home page. Some aspects of the homepage have changed as the website was being produced. 

## Design
The aim of this project was to create a user friendly webpage with a clean layout whilst sticking to the overall theme of the webpage.

## Colours

The colour palette for this website mainly derived from the header image. The header image is one of the Munro Locations in Scotland giving the user an idea of what scenery to expect when walking one of these mountains. The main colours used were green and beige with a darker green for the box shadow.

The colour image below was created using [coolors](https://coolors.co/)
![color palette](https://github.com/GreenNinjaBoy/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/pp1-color-palette.png?raw=true)


## Typography

The fonts for this website were imported from google fonts. For the whole site [Katibeh](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Katibeh?query=Katibeh) was used. This text was chosen as it fits the aesthetics of the website and the content it is based upon. The main colour for the webpage was black with the exception of the main title to which the color white was chosen as it compliments the title image better. 

# Features
The Munro Baggers website comprises of 4 main pages, all of which can be navigated too via the navigation bar at the top of each page. Each page contains a header with the navigation bar and a footer with links to social media sites. The four main pages are:

 - Home
 - Gallery
 - Equipment
 - Sign Up

# Existing Features

### Header and Navigation Bar

 - Featured on all four pages the header has a clickable title and subtitle, that will return the user to the home page and a responsive navigation bar.
 - The navigation bar allows the user to move around the website. The navigation bar incorporates links to Home, Gallery, Equipment and Sign up pages. A  text decoration of underline can be seen when the user hovers over a navigation link.
 - Both the header and navigation links are identical across all four pages which enhances usability and consistency.

![header and navigation bar](https://github.com/GreenNinjaBoy/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/header-nav-bar-image.png?raw=true)

### History Section

 - The history section contains some information for the user about the Munros of Scotland. It is comprised of three sections, each with their own headings.
 - To display the information, this section was split into three sections and displayed into three boxes that fit with the colour scheme of the website.

![image of history section](https://github.com/GreenNinjaBoy/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/history-section-image.png?raw=true)

### Why Join us Section

 - The Why Join us section contains some information about the walking club, the benefits of of walking and also what a user would have access to if the decided to join the club.
 - To display the information this, section was split into four paragraphs, no boxes were used in this section as it appears to flow more naturally. 
 - The fourth paragraph has two internal hyper links that when clicked takes the user either to the sign up page or the contact section within the sign up page. 

![Image of why join us section](https://github.com/GreenNinjaBoy/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/why-join-us-image.png?raw=true)

### Motivational Video

 - The final section of the home page includes a video. This video is designed to inspire and motivate the user to pursue their ambition to walk one of the Munros of Scotland.
 - This video will not auto-play, instead it is up to the user to decide wither or not to play the video. It is appropriate to the website and is motivational to the users.
 
 A link to the video can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sLKi3ltQBA&t=186s)

![motivational video](https://github.com/GreenNinjaBoy/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/video-image.png?raw=true)

### Gallery Page

 - The gallery is an important aspect of this website. It further showcases some of the sights that Scotland has to offer the user.
 - The images are displayed into four columns when the page is shown on a desktop but shrinks to two columns when displayed on smaller devices such as mobile phones.

![gallery on mobile display](https://github.com/GreenNinjaBoy/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/gallery-mobile-display-image.png?raw=true)

### Equipment Page

 - The equipment page contains useful information for the user such as what type of equipment and safety information.
 - To display the information, this section was split into three sections and displayed into three boxes that fit with the colour scheme of the website. Which is very similar to the home page with the exception of instead of the information displaying as a row, they are displayed in a column. This was done to make the page flow more naturally.

![equipment section](https://github.com/GreenNinjaBoy/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/equipment-section-image.png?raw=true)

###Retail Information
 - Retail information was also added to the equipment page which displays three outdoor retailers, with each one clickable and takes the user to that retailers website.

![retail information](https://github.com/GreenNinjaBoy/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/retailers-image.png?raw=true)

### Sign Up Page

![sign up page](https://github.com/GreenNinjaBoy/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/sign-up-image.png?raw=true)

### Contact us

 - Within the signup page there is also a contact section which provides users with further information on ways they can contact the club.
 - The display of this section is similar to the why join us section of the home page as it flows better with the sign up section.

![contact us section](https://github.com/GreenNinjaBoy/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/contact-section-image.png?raw=true)

### Submission/Thank you page

 - When the user completes the sign up form they are redirected to a thank you page.
 - This gives the user an indication that their form has been received and that they have signed up to the Munro Baggers Club.
 - The page will the redirected the user back to the homepage after seven seconds. If the user isn't redirected there is a hyperlink available that will redirect back to the home page.

![thank-you-image](https://github.com/GreenNinjaBoy/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/thank-you-page-image.png?raw=true)

### Social Media Links

 - There is a footer at the bottom of every page and this footer consists of social media links.
 - The inspiration for these links were taken form the "Love Running" walkthrough project delivered by Code Institute. The display icons were chosen from [Font Awesome.](https://fontawesome.com/)
 - when clicked each link will open a new tab for the user directing them to the associated social media website.

![social-media-links](https://github.com/GreenNinjaBoy/Munros-of-Scotland-PP1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/social-media-links.png?raw=true)


### Features Left to Implement

 - Possibly create  a page that would detail planned events the group have organized for the month.
 - A user profile could be created to allow the user to sign into the website.
 - A discussion board created so users can discuss/plan events out with the main club outings.

### Lighthouse Testing

### WCAG Contrast Checker

This checker was used to check the text colour to the background colour on all pages with the option to show what the webpage would look like for users with some visual colour impairment.
when checked the only error that was presenting was the main text and the colour white that was chosen, looking at the program this is because it was comparing the text against the main background colour of green and not the main header image that is is displayed on. It was decided that this text would remain white as it complimented the background and did not effect the over all look of the webpage when looking through the different colour impairment filters.
