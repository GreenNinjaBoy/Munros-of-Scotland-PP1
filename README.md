# Munro Baggers

This website was developed for individuals who are interested in joining a walking club to explore some of the Scottish mountains called "Munros". Users of the sight can find a brief history of these Mountains, the benefits to walking regularly and also a motivational video within the homepage of the website. The Gallery page consists of various images of the Scottish countryside where some of the mountains are located. The website also features an equipment page that gives information on the equipment and preparation required before attempting a walk on one of these mountains and users may opt-in to the sign-up page which will deliver a newsletter on events on a monthly basis. This website was designed to be a starting point to create a community of new and existing hillwalkers interested in walking the Munros of Scotland.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were produced for the home page. Some aspects of the homepage have changed as the website was being produced. 

## Design
The aim of this project was to create a user friendly webpage with a clean layout whilst sticking to the overall theme of the webpage.

## Colours

The colour palette for this website mainly derived from the header image. The header image is one of the Munro Locations in Scotland giving the user an idea of what scenery to expect when walking one of these mountains. The main colours used were green and beige with a darker green for the box shadow.

## Typography

The fonts for this website were imported from google fonts. For the whole site [Katibeh](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Katibeh?query=Katibeh) was used. This text was chosen as it fits the aesthetics of the website and the content it is based upon. The main colour for the webpage was black with the exception of the main title to which the color white was chosen as it compliments the title image better.
