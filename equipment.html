                <p>
                    One of the more inportant pieces of equipment required is a good pair of walking boots, we would
                    reccomend a pair that not only supports your feet butg also your ankles aswell.
                    Some of the munro terrain is challenging and one mis-step could cause an injury.
                    A decent pair of walking boots will help prevent this.

                    Know your routes, check the weather before you leave, You’ll also need lightweight layers and
                    waterproof clothing, to stay dry and warm. Take a map, a torch and a safety kit
                    in case of any accidents, and make sure you carry lots of water and food. Learn how to properly
                    navigate using a map and compass – lots
                    of Munros are remote, so you won’t have phone signal if you get lost or stuck. Be honest about your
                    ability, and
                    remember that even a simple 5-mile walk feels much harder when you’re going uphill.

            <h4>Safety is Essential</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Respect your surroundings and take care all the way. It’s easy to
                relax when the car park’s in sight, and accidents tend to happen when you’re not focused on your
                footing. It’s also a
                good idea to tell people where you’re going. Wither you are walking with other members of the club or
                taking on one of the giants solo
                We suggest you leave a route card and an estimated return time with someone
                who can call for help if you don’t come back on schedule.
                <br>
                Most importantly, have fun! Scotland’s Munros are some of the most spectacular places on Earth. Take the
                time to soak up
                the views and appreciate the grandeur of our wonderful wild spaces.
