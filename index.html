            <h2>What is a Munro?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The Munros are mountains within Scotland with an elevation of over 3000 feet (914 meters), and you
                can
                'bag' a Munro by reaching the summit. The offical list of these mountains is a staggering 282 peaks
                across Scotland.</p>

            <h2> Why Named Munro? </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Munros are named after Sir Hugh Munro, 4th Baronet (1856â€“1919), who produced the first list of such
                hills, known as
                Munro's Tables, in 1891.
                Sir Hugh also added what he considered lesser peaks now known today as 'Munro-Tops' which are also
                over
                3000 feet but lower than the nearby primary mountain.
                As off December 2020 the total number of Munros are 282 with 226 Munro-tops.

                A 'Compleater' is the name given to someone who has 'bagged' all of the munros on Sir Hugh Munros
                list.
                The first person to do so was Rev A E Robertson in 1901.
                Sadly Sir Hugh himself was never able to complete the list as he passed away with only 3 left to go.
